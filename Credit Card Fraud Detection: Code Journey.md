## **🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Data Science Journey**  

Fraud detection is a critical challenge in the financial industry. In this project, I developed a **machine learning pipeline** to identify fraudulent transactions step by step, tackling the issue of class imbalance and optimizing model performance.  

---

### **📂 Dataset Overview**  
- The dataset contains **284,807 transactions**, with only **492 fraudulent cases (0.172%)**.  
- Features are anonymized using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for security.  

---

## **🔍 Step 1: Understanding the Data**  
✔ Loaded the dataset and checked for **missing values** (none found).  
✔ Identified **high class imbalance**—fraud cases are extremely rare.  
✔ Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - **Visualized fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.**  
  - Observed fraud transactions often have **lower amounts**.  
  - Used **correlation heatmaps** to identify important features.  

---

## **🛠 Step 2: Data Preprocessing**  
✔ **Removed duplicate transactions** to ensure data integrity.  
✔ **Standardized** the `Amount` and `Time` features using **MinMaxScaler**.  
✔ **Reduced dataset skewness** by transforming highly skewed features.

## **📊 Step 3: Handling Class Imbalance**  
Since fraud cases are rare, traditional models would struggle. To address this, I applied:  

✅ **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** → Generates synthetic fraud cases to balance the dataset.  
✅ **NearMiss (Under-sampling)** → Reduces the majority class to avoid overwhelming the model.  

---

## **🤖 Step 4: Training Machine Learning Models**  
Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.  
Trained multiple models to compare performance:  

✅ **Logistic Regression** – Baseline model, interpretable.  
✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Good for high-dimensional data.  
✅ **Random Forest** – Robust and effective for fraud detection.  
✅ **Deep Learning (Neural Network)** – Extracts complex fraud patterns.

## **📈 Step 5: Evaluating & Comparing Models**  
Since fraud detection is an **imbalanced classification problem**, accuracy alone is misleading. I used:  

✔ **Precision-Recall AUC** → Measures how well fraud is detected.  
✔ **F1-Score** → Balances precision and recall.  
✔ **ROC-AUC Score** → Measures classification performance.  

🔹 **Best Model Selection:**  
- If **Random Forest** achieves the best results → Ideal for real-time fraud detection.  
- If **Neural Network** performs better → Deep learning can be the future of fraud detection!  

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**  
🔹 Optimize hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.  
🔹 Deploy the best model as a **real-time fraud detection API**.  
🔹 Experiment with **unsupervised learning** for anomaly detection.

## **📌 Conclusion**  
By using **machine learning and deep learning techniques**, this project successfully enhances **fraud detection accuracy** while minimizing false positives, ensuring better security for financial transactions.
