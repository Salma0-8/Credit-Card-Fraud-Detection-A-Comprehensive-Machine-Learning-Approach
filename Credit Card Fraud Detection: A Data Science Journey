**🚀 CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION: A DATA SCIENCE JOURNEY**  

Fraud detection is crucial in the financial industry. This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to identify fraudulent transactions step by step.  

**🔍 STEP 1: UNDERSTANDING THE DATA**  
- Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values (none found).  
- Found **high class imbalance** (fraud cases are rare).  

**🛠 STEP 2: DATA PREPROCESSING**  
- Removed duplicates and normalized the `Amount` and `Time` columns.  

**📊 STEP 3: HANDLING CLASS IMBALANCE**  
- Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic fraud cases and balance the dataset.  

**🤖 STEP 4: TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS**  
- Split the data into training and testing sets.  
- Trained multiple models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Random Forest  
  - Deep Learning (Neural Network)  

**📈 STEP 5: EVALUATING & COMPARING MODELS**  
- Used **Precision-Recall AUC** (important for fraud detection).  
- Best model depends on results:  
  - If **Random Forest** performs best → Ideal for real-time fraud detection.  
  - If **Neural Network** wins → Deep learning is the future!
