**🚀Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Data Science Journey**  

Fraud detection is crucial in the financial industry. In this project, we built a **machine learning pipeline** to identify fraudulent transactions step by step.  

**🔍Step 1: Understanding the Data**  
- Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values (none found).  
- Found **high class imbalance** (fraud cases are rare).  

**🛠Step 2: Data Preprocessing**  
- **Removed duplicates** and **normalized** the `Amount` and `Time` columns.  

**📊Step 3: Handling Class Imbalance**  
- Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic fraud cases and balance the dataset.  

**🤖Step 4: Training Machine Learning Models**  
- **Split the data** into training and testing sets.  
- Trained multiple models:  
  ✅ Logistic Regression  
  ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  ✅ Random Forest  
  ✅ Deep Learning (Neural Network)  

**📈Step 5: Evaluating & Comparing Models**  
- Used **Precision-Recall AUC** (important for fraud detection).  
- **Best model** depends on results:  
  - If **Random Forest** performs best → Ideal for real-time fraud detection.  
  - If **Neural Network** wins → Deep learning is the future!
