# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Data Science Journey  

Fraud detection is crucial in the financial industry. This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to identify fraudulent transactions step by step.  

## 🔍 Step 1: Understanding the Data  
✔ Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values (none found).  
✔ Found **high class imbalance** (fraud cases are rare).  

## 🛠 Step 2: Data Preprocessing  
✔ **Removed duplicates** and **normalized** the `Amount` and `Time` columns.  

## 📊 Step 3: Handling Class Imbalance  
✔ Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic fraud cases and balance the dataset.  

## 🤖 Step 4: Training Machine Learning Models  
✔ **Split the data** into training and testing sets.  
✔ Trained multiple models:  
  - ✅ Logistic Regression  
  - ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - ✅ Random Forest  
  - ✅ Deep Learning (Neural Network)  

## 📈 Step 5: Evaluating & Comparing Models  
✔ Used **Precision-Recall AUC** (important for fraud detection).  
✔ **Best model** depends on results:  
  - If **Random Forest** performs best → Ideal for real-time fraud detection.  
  - If **Neural Network** wins → Deep learning is the future!
